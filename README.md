I am a 22y old student from Belgium. <br><br>
I have always had an interest in IT, but since my study at Encora Berchem, this got more specific. I did this study between high school and college, since I had absolutely no idea what to do with my future. It is a great thing I made this choice, since here I discovered my passion for Linux, networking, system infrastructure and cyber security. <br><br>
My programming skills still need some sharpening, but I am mostly programming in C, Python and I am currently learning Java as well. Other than that, I also work with Docker, Bash, PowerShell and plan to learn more about Terraform as well.<br><br>
Other, unrelated interests are learning languages, mainly Roman languages such as French, Spanish, Italian, Latin...
